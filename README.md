The Cybrid iOS SDK for cryptocurrency transactions and financial services offers a comprehensive solution for iOS applications. We provide customizable UI screens and elements to efficiently collect user data. Moreover, we expose low-level APIs to enable the creation of entirely customized user experiences. Whether it's for cryptocurrency transactions, identity verification (KYC), or managing bank accounts and wallets, our SDK simplifies integration into your iOS app, ensuring flexibility and quality.

## Installation

### CocoaPods

Add our podspec repo to your App's Podfile:

`source 'git@github.com:Cybrid-app/cybrid-podspecs.git'`

And then install the dependencies

`pod install CybridSDK`

## Usage

### 1. Setup SDK

The SDK must have a `bearer` token to interact with the platform APIs.

When integrating with your service, the token would be generated by your backend server.

For demonstration purposes **only**, we request a token in the demo application using the bank's credentials.

Once you have a token, setup the SDK with the following:

```
Cybrid.setup(bearer: bearerToken,
             customerGUID: guid ?? "",
             fiat: .usd)
```

### 2. Logger

The SDK supports supplying a logger implementation for events that are generated at runtime.

You can create your own logger implementation that extends our `CybridLogger` class. For example, a simple implementation might be as follows:

```
final class ClientLogger: CybridLogger {
	func log(_ event: CybridEvent) {
		print("\(event.level.rawValue):\(event.code) - \(event.message)")
	}
}
```

To configure the logger, supply it to the SDK during setup as follows:

```
Cybrid.setup(...
             logger: ClientLogger())
```

### 3. Use our Components:

The SDK implements a set of `ViewController` components that you can integrate easily in your application.

- Price List View:

This component is an isolated view that displays the latest prices of the support assets on the platform.

```
let tableView = CryptoPriceListView()
```

- Trade Component: 

This component display the latest prices of the supported assets and allow you to trade (i.e. buy or sell) the asset.

```
let tableView = CryptoPriceListView(navigationController: navigationController)
```

- Accounts Component:


This component allows you to display the available accounts and get the details for each account.


```
let accounts = AccountsViewController()
```

## Demo App

To setup the demo app you have two options:

- 1: Add enviroment vars into the system

```
export CybridClientId = 'XXXX'
export CybridClientSecret = 'XXXX'
export CybridCustomerGUID = 'XXXX'
```

- 2: Use the Login Screen and pass the `clientId`, `clientSecret` and `customerGuid` values.

The demo application can be run on the simulator or on a physical device.
